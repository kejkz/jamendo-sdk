## Description

This is my attempt to write useful ruby-based API handler for Jamendo music library. Started as a fun, and will stay fun. I am currently attemping to learn as much Ruby as I can, and this will provide me some interesting moments 

## Usage

It will be failrly easy to use this framework, although, according to Jamendo's documentation, there are a lot of parameters to all API calls, but I will try to get them to reasonable amount and do that in most appropriate way

## Coverage
Right now, coverage of all methods is not full in any way, that's why my main focus will be to do one method at time, to provide best possible availabillity of all them to users.
